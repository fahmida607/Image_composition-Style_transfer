# Image_composition-Style_transfer
Extracted content representation of the input content image from the activation map ‘Conv4_2’ layer of  a pre-trained VGG19 model and style representation of the input style image from calculation of Gram Matrix from the activation maps of the ‘Conv1_1’, ‘Conv2_1’, ‘Conv3_1’, ‘Conv4_1’, ‘Conv5_1’ layers of the pre-trained VGG19 model as mentioned in this paper and optimized combined content and style loss between the content and style representation of the target output image and those of the content image and style image to transfer the style from ‘input style’ image to ‘input content’ image. Finally after adding style and content losses, the final total loss was 3090570.0 which was high at first iteration but gradually decreased after few iteration.
